# Advance Weather App

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Advance Weather App** provides real-time weather information and is crafted using a robust architectural framework adhering to SOLID principles. This ensures the application is scalable, maintainable, and efficiently handles complexities of data operations.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Get up-to-the-minute weather updates.
- **Custom Weather Forecasts**: Tailored forecasts based on user preferences and past searches.
- **Interactive Maps**: Dynamic weather maps with overlay options including precipitation and temperature.

## 🛠️ Architecture Components

- **Use Cases**: Isolate specific business logic of the application, facilitating interaction between the UI and the domain layer.
- **Repositories**: Define interfaces for data operations to promote interchangeability and testability.
- **Repository Implementations**: Handle data retrieval and management from diverse sources such as APIs and local databases.
- **Data Sources**: Abstract the essential operations required from external data sources.
- **Data Source Implementations**: Secure and manage API interactions with detailed network calls.

## 🔄 State Management

This app leverages the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern to manage the state, ensuring a reactive and performant UI by decoupling the business logic from UI components. This approach helps in:
- **Maintaining Clean Code**: Business logic is kept separate from UI code, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- **Efficient State Updates**: Only relevant widgets are rebuilt when the state changes, optimizing performance.

## 🎯 Error Handling

The app implements sophisticated error handling strategies to distinguish between server and generic failures, improving both user experience and debugging:
- **Server Failures**: Specific exceptions are managed based on the API responses.
- **Generic Failures**: Broad error categories capture unforeseen issues, ensuring the app's robustness.

## 🛡️ Security Measures

Security is paramount in the Advance Weather App:
- **Data Encryption**: Utilizes strong encryption standards for data storage and transmission.
- **API Security**: Secured API endpoints with access tokens to prevent unauthorized access.
